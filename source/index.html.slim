      Baccano generates a unique avatar image using a hash of the user's ID
      (or what ever else you want to put in there ‚õÑÔ∏è). The algorithm uses the
      hash to generate a color palate, and accessories. These accessory
      variations, combined with hash-determined color values, which means
      there are millions of unique avatars!!

      If you want just a random image use
      `<img src="https://avatar.baccano.io">` and we‚Äôll generate a random base
      64 string and image for you! ‚úä
